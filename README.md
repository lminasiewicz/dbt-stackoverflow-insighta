If you're reading this, hi!

Most of the work has been done in the `models/` directory.
At one point I use a function from dbt_utils library. Please note that dbt_packages is in .gitignore - run dbt deps.
For any additional information regarding the project, please refer to the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hEEuRDSqQ6GbLvS1jkzMtQbqdpRGbk7IWctQle-xBqI/edit?usp=sharing) I'm sending as part of the assessment.
